# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
library(data.table)

setwd("/Users/cching/Coursera/Reproducible Research/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- data.table(read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
str(data)
colnames(data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
totals <- data[, sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE), by = date]
totals_mean <- mean(totals$V1)
totals_median <- median(totals$V1)
hist(totals$V1)

```

### The mean total steps is `r totals_mean` and the median is `r totals_median`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
avgs <- data[, mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), by = interval]
plot(avgs, type = "l")
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
